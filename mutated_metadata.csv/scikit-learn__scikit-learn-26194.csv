    """"""Compute Receiver operating characteristic (ROC).

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <roc_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        True binary labels. If labels are not either {-1, 1} or {0, 1}, then
        pos_label should be explicitly given.

    y_score : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by ""decision_function"" on some classifiers).

    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=None
        The label of the positive class.
        When ``pos_label=None``, if `y_true` is in {-1, 1} or {0, 1},
        ``pos_label`` is set to 1, otherwise an error will be raised.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    drop_intermediate : bool, default=True
        Whether to drop some suboptimal thresholds which would not appear
        on a plotted ROC curve. This is useful in order to create lighter
        ROC curves.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           parameter *drop_intermediate*.

    Returns
    -------
    fpr : ndarray of shape (>2,)
        Increasing false positive rates such that element i is the false
        positive rate of predictions with score >= `thresholds[i]`.

    tpr : ndarray of shape (>2,)
        Increasing true positive rates such that element `i` is the true
        positive rate of predictions with score >= `thresholds[i]`.

    thresholds : ndarray of shape = (n_thresholds,)
        Decreasing thresholds on the decision function used to compute
        fpr and tpr. `thresholds[0]` represents no instances being predicted
        and is arbitrarily set to `max(y_score) + 1`.

    --------
    RocCurveDisplay.from_estimator : Plot Receiver Operating Characteristic
        (ROC) curve given an estimator and some data.
    RocCurveDisplay.from_predictions : Plot Receiver Operating Characteristic
        (ROC) curve given the true and predicted values.
    det_curve: Compute error rates for different probability thresholds.
    roc_auc_score : Compute the area under the ROC curve.

    Notes
    -----
    Since the thresholds are sorted from low to high values, they
    are reversed upon returning them to ensure they correspond to both ``fpr``
    and ``tpr``, which are sorted in reversed order during their calculation.
